The model worked well and gave the results on folders \sigma01 \sigma10 but then after consecutive runs its broke so the 
results for \sigmah are not good, betraying that the model was broken. 
We didn't manage to save the trained model but in the jypiter file \model the results are those of a prior run with sigma01. 
They are not the final results found on the folder \sigma01 but that is because we didn't commit that changes before it broke. 
Regardless, the plost for sigmad*0.1  sigmad*10 are both valid and good.
